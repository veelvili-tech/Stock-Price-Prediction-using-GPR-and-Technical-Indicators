# Project Background 

This project focuses on predicting the stock closing prices of Lockheed Martin (LMT) using a combination of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and hybrid ensemble models. The defence sector is highly sensitive to geopolitical risks and policy changes, making accurate forecasting particularly challenging. To address this, the study integrates historical stock data, technical indicators, and the Geopolitical Risk (GPR) index to improve prediction robustness during volatile market conditions. Built hybrid machine learning models to predict defense stock prices using Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR) and technical indicators, providing insights into the impact of geopolitical events on market trends.
